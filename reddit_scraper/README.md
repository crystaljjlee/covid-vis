# Reddit Data Scraper

This is a simple scraper that uses [pushshift.io](pushshift.io) to download reddit comments into
a csv file. 

To run this scraper, you'll need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) > 3.6 installed. 

To change the query, you need to modify the last lines of reddit_scraper.py. Once you run that
script, the new csv will be downloaded to the data folder.
